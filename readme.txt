Hi i am "Sheikh Farhan", currently pursuing B-tech at NIT-BHOPAL.

Given are the top standard questions/algorithms of DSA. I have taken all the Questions from
"geeksforgeeks",therefore simply putting the question on google will get exact question very easily.

Most Important:
1-: As I'm only a student, therefore it may contains errors in the code of the solution, any change would be appreciated you can email me on        "farhansheikhfs@gmail.com".
2-: I only take care of the time complexity not space. Hence only time complexity is mention in the code.
3-: I tried to use different forms, to take the input from the user specially in graph.

*** Thanks for reading ***
